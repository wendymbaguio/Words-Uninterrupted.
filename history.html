				<h1 class="title"> history. </h1>
				<p>As I said earlier, I would be fulfilling my desire through typing out my creations instead of writing them down. <br>

				</br>My works entail daunting, delicate, and descriptive depictions of girlhood and what it feels like to be a female of 
					the same age—someone at the height of what I like to call "pubescence juvenescence" and the peak of irresponsible, 
					brash youth.
			</div>

			<div class="content-right">
				<p>I identify myself as a pessimist. <br>
					</br>I believe things are bound to go wrong, as if they already aren't. We live to crash 
					and burn. We act only to fail. We are simply incorrect. It is excruciating to stand idly by and pretend as if 
					everything was fine. And so, with each passing day of holding in, my urge to burst out rises. This website is my 
					eruption, my detonation of everything I held back. </p>

			<p><span>Over the years,</span> I have also accumulated my fair share of insecurities. No surprises there! You need to possess a 
				sufficient amount of self-doubt in order to embody the value of "humility", though I seem to have contained more than 
				what is required. I do not have a proper medium to expel this to, thus the creation of this website. 

				I aspire to make a<span> safe space</span>; a sanctuary for troubled individuals. Where problems as small as your self-confidence 
				isn't shunned nor made fun of, we embrace every petty little problem for everyone punished. </p> <!--add a shadow through

				<h1 class="etymology"> etymology: </h1>
				<p>The title of the website “Words Uninterrupted” references the phrase found in the introduction: “I am a girl, always 
					interrupted.” This means that all the content found in said website are essentially all the words the I struggle to 
					express, hence it has been condensed into mere scriptures.
