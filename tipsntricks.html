		<h1>Writing Poetry</h1>

		<div class="container1">
			<h2>Brainstorming</h2>
			<p>I tend to mindlessly write down what I think of first, despite all the possible 
				grammatical errors. Comparably, its just as if I was throwing random things on the wall 
				to see what sticks Luckily, modern or "trending" poetry these days don't really have a 
				standard form or format, so its become easier! I've come to know this step as the 
				"Brainstorming" aspect. Its also what I like to call as - pardon my language - 
				"the crappy draft", which embodies this step perfectly. I make multiple half-hearted but 
				still serious drafts and see which ones are of worth. Then we move on to the next step: </p>
		</div>

		<div id="container2">
			<div class="content-right">
				<h2>Compare & Contrast</h2>
				<p>After I formulate every random thought I've ever had (which takes a while), I review and 
				reorganize everything into a comprehensive passage. I take into account the arrangement and the usage of certain words. Errors and 
				redundancies are erased and replaced with something more fitting. I rid of anything 
					unnecessary and unintelligible. During these trying times, I also use my fair share of advanced technology for some 
					help! Visit my favorite: <a href="https://www.powerthesaurus.org" target="_blank">thesaurus website</a>,
					I also reccomend <a href="https://www.losethevery.com/?email=wendymbaguio%40gmail.com&ref=sparkloop-upscribe" target="_blank">LoseTheVery</a>.

				Or <a href="https://bard.google.com/chat" target="_blank">Bard </a>by Google!</p> 
				<p>Although some results are questionable, I remind myself that things were bound to go this 
				way and there is no escaping the hideous. I've created quite a lot of quality works though,
				which I am willing to share here! Check the "my abominations" page for more :3</p>

		<h1>Writing Essays</h1>
			<div id="container1">
				<div class="content-right">
					<p>In writing essays, take into account that you don't have to necessarily <span>start at the</span>
						introduction. A bad mood will certainly reflect in your works, and will result into 
						a  malicious piece. So if you don't feel like starting with the intro, don't do it! 
						Start with the body for all we care! c: and despite how ironic it is, you could also 
						start with the conclusion! If you don't feel like writing at all, then don't! Start 
						with jotting down ideas and brainstorming multiple one-liners to incorporate later. 
						It doesn't matter how horrid it is, its only the draft, and you're not going to die. 
						It doesn't hurt if you try. And it most certainly won't be judged by your audience's 
						eyes. Much less be known!</p>
				</div>

				<div class="content-middle">

				</div>
				
				<div class="content-right">
					<p>As the saying goes, "the end justifies the means". This is also helpful for overcoming
						writer's block or finding inspiration. Because hey, at least you tried right? 
   
					   It is of great help to have niche interests that may fuel your brain. Finding amusing 
					   topics and subjects should also boost your productivity in writing. Check the "inspo" 
					   page to explore more about this topic! c:</p>
					   <p>I've had my fair share of the good, the bad, and the atrocious. And yes, while you 
						certainly can't avoid the unpleasant, you can drive for the most resplendent "good"
						you've ever had the pleasure of writing. The most important thing of all is to not 
						lose up, not give up, be resilient, and <span>be patient</span>. Talent truly takes time.  </p>

		<h1>In conclusion,</h1>
			<div class="container1">
				<p>For poetry: write and write and write and write even if feels terrible. at some point, you will 
					achieve something excellent. and you will be able to learn from this experience. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="container2">
				<p>For essays: just write something. write ideas, write content, write random sentences, 
					write the conclusion, write a body, write an intro. <span>Just write anything related to it!</span>
					If you then find yourself in the mood to do it, then do it immediately!
					
					slow and steady wins the race c:</p>
