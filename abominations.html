							<li>im okay i swear</li>
							<li>the speaker is comparing and more of contrasting itself to the "slim" figure 
							most of the people of its age possess. they are expressing dissatisfaction to 
							their own body and deem that they have "ruined" the once-perfect form given to them.</li>
							<li>how the speaker is essentially blaming everyone who shamed them for their

								<li>a haiku i made in 8th grade</li>

									in english 2</li>
								<li>although haikus were written to describe nature and the aesthetic

									used to convey love to loved ones in the heian period</li>
								<li>i had quite the "haiku writing era" last year ..... it was really 
									embarrassing so i'd rather not say anything</li>
